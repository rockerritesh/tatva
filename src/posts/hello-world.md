# Welcome to My Blog!

This is my first post on **Tatva**, my new personal blog. I'm excited to start sharing my thoughts, learnings, and experiences with you.

## What to Expect

In this blog, you'll find:

- Technical tutorials and guides
- Personal reflections on software development
- Project updates and showcases
- Tips and tricks I've learned along the way

## Why "Tatva"?

"Tatva" is a Sanskrit word meaning "essence" or "principle." I chose this name because I want this blog to capture the essence of my journey as a developer and share the fundamental principles that guide my work.

## The Tech Stack

This blog is built with:

- **Vite** for fast development and building
- **Marked.js** for markdown parsing
- **Vanilla JavaScript** for interactivity
- **CSS Custom Properties** for theming
- **GitHub Pages** for hosting

Thanks for visiting, and I hope you find something valuable here!
