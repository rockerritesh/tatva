# 🌟 A Trilogy of AI Magic: portfolio.llm, vibe\_coder & agents.ai

**1. portfolio.llm — Your Living, Chatty Portfolio**
This isn’t your run‑of‑the‑mill GitHub page—it’s a **conversational resume powered by LLMs**. Chat with it, ask about projects, and watch it spin up summaries on the fly. A bold experiment in “personal branding via AI.”

**2. vibe\_coder — Build a Vibe, Not Just Code**
Tell the agent your idea—**no syntax needed**—and it sculpts the scaffolding, picks Streamlit or FastAPI, wires up environments, and even asks questions to refine your vision. It’s like having a coding buddy tuned to your vibe.

**3. agents.ai — Assemble Your AI Dream Team**
Here, your idea gets sent through an **autonomous pipeline**. One agent breaks it down, another writes, another tests, another debug‑grows—until your application materializes. It’s agentic dev from spark to ship.

## 🎯 Why It Matters

* **Interactive branding:** portfolios that speak back.
* **Vibe-first creation:** apps born from conversation.
* **Agent orchestration:** creativity meets automation.

## 🚀 The Next Spark

Mix them up: chat‑with‑your‑portfolio, vibe‑code your next app, and let agents.ai deploy it—all in one smooth AI‑powered loop.

**Dive in:**

* Chat with your bio via **portfolio.llm** [Here](https://llm.sumityadav.com.np/)
* “Vibe‑code” a mini app using **vibe\_coder**  [Here](https://github.com/rockerritesh/vibe_coder)
* Let **agents.ai** refine and deploy it [Here](https://github.com/rockerritesh/agents.ai)

These projects form a crisp three-act play in AI-driven self‑expression and automation. Want to join the brainstorm or help add new vibes and frameworks? Let’s build the future together!
