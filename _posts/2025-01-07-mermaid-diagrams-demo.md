# Mermaid Diagrams Demo: Visual Storytelling in Tatva

Welcome to the visual side of Tatva! 🎨 Today we're showcasing the brand new **Mermaid.js integration** that allows you to create beautiful diagrams directly in your markdown files.

## What is Mermaid?

Mermaid is a diagramming and charting tool that uses text-based syntax to create diagrams. It's perfect for documentation, explaining processes, and visualizing complex ideas.

---

## 🔄 Flowchart Example

Let's start with a simple flowchart showing the Tatva blog building process:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Write Markdown Post] --> B{Contains Mermaid?}
    B -->|Yes| C[Process Mermaid Blocks]
    B -->|No| D[Convert to HTML]
    C --> D
    D --> E[Apply Layout Templates]
    E --> F[Generate Static Files]
    F --> G[Deploy to GitHub Pages]
    G --> H[📝 Live Blog Post!]
    
    style A fill:#e1f5fe
    style H fill:#c8e6c9
    style C fill:#fff3e0
```

## 🔁 Sequence Diagram

Here's how a user interacts with the Tatva website:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant Browser
    participant CDN
    participant GitHub
    
    User->>Browser: Visit tatva.sumityadav.com.np
    Browser->>CDN: Load Mermaid.js
    Browser->>GitHub: Fetch static files
    GitHub-->>Browser: Return HTML + CSS
    CDN-->>Browser: Return Mermaid library
    Browser->>Browser: Render diagrams
    Browser-->>User: Display beautiful blog
    
    Note over User,Browser: All rendering happens client-side
    Note over GitHub: Static files generated by build.js
```

## 🏗️ System Architecture

Let's visualize the Tatva website architecture:

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph "Content Creation"
        A[📝 Markdown Files]
        B[🎨 SCSS Styles]
        C[📄 Layout Templates]
    end
    
    subgraph "Build Process"
        D[🔧 build.js]
        E[📚 marked.js]
        F[🎭 Mermaid Processor]
    end
    
    subgraph "Output"
        G[📂 docs/ folder]
        H[🌐 Static HTML]
        I[💅 Compiled CSS]
    end
    
    A --> D
    B --> D
    C --> D
    D --> E
    D --> F
    E --> G
    F --> G
    G --> H
    G --> I
    
    style D fill:#ff6b6b
    style G fill:#4ecdc4
```
