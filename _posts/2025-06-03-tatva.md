# **Types of Tattva: Understanding the Building Blocks of Existence**

In Indian philosophical traditions, *Tattva* refers to the fundamental realities or principles that constitute existence. The term comes from Sanskrit *“Tat”* (that) and *“Tvam”* (thou), implying *“thatness”* or *“principle of reality.”* Different schools enumerate tattvas differently, but their core purpose is to explain the universe’s composition and human experience within it.

Below is an exploration of **major classifications of tattvas**, including **Samkhya**, **Shaivism**, **Vedanta**, and the universally accepted **Pancha Tattva (Five Elements).**

## 🌿 **Pancha Tattva: The Five Great Elements**

Almost all Indian philosophies accept the concept of **Pancha Mahabhuta** or **Pancha Tattva**, the five elemental principles forming the gross world. They are:

1. **Akasha (Ether / Space)**
   – Represents emptiness, sound, vibration, and expansion. It is the medium through which sound travels and denotes openness and connection.

2. **Vayu (Air / Wind)**
   – Represents movement, force, and life energy (prana). It is associated with touch and flexibility.

3. **Agni (Fire)**
   – Represents transformation, heat, light, and metabolism. It governs digestion, perception, and illumination.

4. **Jala (Water)**
   – Represents cohesion, fluidity, and taste. It manifests as liquids, blood, and all bodily fluids, supporting life and purification.

5. **Prithvi (Earth)**
   – Represents solidity, stability, and smell. It forms bones, flesh, minerals, and all that is dense and structured.

### 🔷 **Symbolism and Application**

* **Ayurveda**: These elements form the **Tridosha (Vata, Pitta, Kapha)** combinations.
* **Yoga & Tantra**: They are activated through **chakra meditation** and **mudras** to balance physical and spiritual health.
* **Spiritual Significance**: They teach us to stay grounded (*Prithvi*), adaptable (*Jala*), transformative (*Agni*), light (*Vayu*), and expansive (*Akasha*).

## 🌌 **2. Shaivism (Kashmir Shaivism): 36 Tattvas**

Shaivism, particularly **Kashmir Shaivism**, presents **36 tattvas**, expanding upon Samkhya by including **spiritual realities above Purusha**. They are grouped as:

### **a. Śuddha Tattvas (Pure Tattvas)**

1. **Shiva**
2. **Shakti**
3. **Sadashiva**
4. **Ishvara**
5. **Shuddhavidya**

### **b. Śuddha-ashuddha Tattvas (Pure-Impure Tattvas)**

6. **Maya**
   7-11. **Five Kanchukas (limitations)** – Kala (time), Vidya (knowledge), Raga (attachment), Niyati (order), and Kala (limitation of power).
7. **Purusha**

### **c. Ashuddha Tattvas (Impure Tattvas)**

13. **Prakriti**
    14-36. **Same as Samkhya’s Buddhi to Prithvi**

📝 *Here, pure tattvas represent divine aspects of Shiva consciousness, while impure tattvas relate to material existence including Pancha Tattva.*

## 🕉 **3. Vedanta View**

In Vedanta, especially **Advaita Vedanta**, tattva defines **Brahman’s nature** rather than as detailed enumeration. The core tattvas are understood as:

* **Sat (Existence)**
* **Chit (Consciousness)**
* **Ananda (Bliss)**

These three constitute **Satchidananda**, the essential reality.

Lists tattvas differently, focusing on **spiritual liberation**:

1. **Jiva (soul)**
2. **Ajiva (non-soul)**

4. **Bandha (bondage)**
5. **Samvara (stoppage)**
6. **Nirjara (shedding)**
7. **Moksha (liberation)**

### **b. Yoga**
