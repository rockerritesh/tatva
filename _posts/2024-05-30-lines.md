A road has distance,
A path has direction,
A journey has purpose,
A life has connection.

Lines drawn in sand,
Fading with the tide,
But the road remains,
A constant guide.

From here to there,
From now to then,
The road stretches on,
Beyond our ken.

Each step we take,
Each choice we make,
Shapes the journey,
For our own sake.

So walk with purpose,
Walk with grace,
For every road,
Leads to its place.
